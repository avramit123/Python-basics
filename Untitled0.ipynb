        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a popular programming language because it's easy to learn, versatile, and can run on many platforms. It's used for many applications, including web development, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\n",
        "   It is popular because,it is Easy to learn,Cross-platform,Open source\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "    - A Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It's a core component of Python, allowing users to test and run their code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   -Keywords are reserved words in Python that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names). They are crucial for defining the structure and logic of Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - Keywords are reserved words in Python that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). They are essential for defining the structure and logic of Python code. The number of keywords may vary slightly between Python versions, but the core set remains consistent.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   -Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it is created. If an object is mutable, its state or value can be changed in place, without creating a new object.  \n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation, while lists are mutable and can be modified. Additionally, tuples are more memory-efficient compared to lists. Tuples can't be changed after they're created, but lists can be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "    - The 'is' is known as the identity operator. The == operator helps us compare the equality of objects. The is operator helps us check whether different variables point towards a similar object in the memory. We use the == operator in Python when the values of both the operands are very much equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   - Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify boolean values (True or False). There are three main logical operators: and, or, and not.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing a variable's data type. In Python, it allows you to convert values from one type to another, such as converting a string to an integer or a float to an integer. Type casting can be explicit, where the programmer specifies the conversion, or implicit, where Python automatically performs the conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit type casting (or conversion) happens automatically by the compiler, while explicit type casting (or type casting) requires the programmer to explicitly instruct the conversion, often when there's a risk of data loss.   \n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "   -Conditional statements in Python, like if, elif, and else, allow you to control the flow of your program's execution by executing different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true   \n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - 'for' loops are well-suited for structured tasks with a known number of iterations, while 'while' loops are better for more complicated looping requirements and dynamic conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "   - In programming, for loops are best used when you know the number of iterations ahead of time, whereas a while loop is best used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance. Both methods can help you iterate through your code\n",
